                <p class="faded"> Since its 2013 debut, Citi Bike's popularity has soared, doubling its fleet and tripling daily rides, now available on the Lyft app, but security concerns with brakes and batteries have led to the removal of 2,500 e-bikes from its fleets in NYC, San Francisco, and Washington DC. </p>

                <p class="faded"> Citibike completes its Manhattan expansion by extending to Inwood and Washington Heights, launches in Hoboken to create a seamless bikeshare system with Jersey City and NYC, and faces more complicated and unpredictable riding patterns due to hybrid work schedules, school reopenings, and warm weather recreational rides.

                <p class="faded"> Citibike, with over 30,000 bikes and 2,000 stations, plans to have ebikes make up half its fleet by 2024, and despite their popularity in NYC and appearances in shows like Succession, Blue Bloods, and Entergalactic, the agreement with NYC lacks system expansion or public funding.

                    Citibike is raising prices to fund station upgrades and more e-bikes, with plans to open its first electrified stations later this year to streamline e-bike charging and reduce manual battery swaps by 80 percent. </p>
